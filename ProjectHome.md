**Glare** is a server-based technology that enables connectivity between VisualWorks Smalltalk and Adobe AIR, Flex and Flash clients. Like Adobe's Java based BlazeDS product (previously known as Adobe LifeCycle Data Services ES), Glare implements the remoting and web messaging protocols required to communicate with these clients and allow the clients to perform RPC calls on the server.

**Glare-DataServices** (or GlareDS) provides the server component that allows Flash applications to perform methods on Smalltalk services. GlareDS is build on top of the Opentalk library and therefore can also run next to the Seaside framework in VisualWorks and WebVelocity.
